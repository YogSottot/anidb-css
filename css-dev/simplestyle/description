Internet Explorer not supported due to a css bug. 
Well, what should I say ... I kept it simple and clean. If it's too bright for you, turn down your screen brightness, use sunglasses or wait for a dark version ;)
Thanks to zak, Rar and pelican for the css help. In case you've wondered where the profile link is - it's the big P on the top right ;)
