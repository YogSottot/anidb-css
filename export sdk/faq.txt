---------------------------------



1. Can I include images, external stylesheets/javascript files with my templates?

	Yes, you can copy stylesheet or javascript files directly into the template directory.

	However images should be placed in a seperate zip file and will be hosted on anidb and linked

	on the export page for seperate download. The images will _not_ be automatically included

	into the tgz file the user downloads.

	You also can't include subdirectories, you have to copy the files directly into the

	directory of your template.





2. How do i create files other than .htm ?

	Take a look at the csv-minimal theme. You need to create a file called extension.dat

	which only contains the desired extension, _without_ the dot!





3. What is that info.dat file?

	It's meant to provide the user with a short info about the template. The content should

	not be too long but is otherwise left to the author of the template.

	However, it is strongly recommended to begin the file with 3 special lines:

		(C) 2003 by EXP
		Version: 0.01 (08.07.2003)
		

	1. copyright of the template author, you may include your email address here

	2. version number and date

	3. one empty line
