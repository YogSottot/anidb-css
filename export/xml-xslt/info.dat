Version 0.1 (21/05/2005)

Template created by Siddhi Pittayachawan (style modified from html-orangewhite)

This theme:
- Compliant with W3C standards
- Coded with XML, XSLT, DHTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Works with only browsers that fully support XML and XSLT
- May not displayed correctly on IE because IE partially supports CSS and XML
- Uses JavaScript as little as possible because XSLT can operate considerably faster than JavaScript
- Tested with Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4
- Allows you to easily change theme's colours by modifying a CSS file
- Allows you to easily change theme's layout by modifying XSLT files
- Data (XML), data formats (XSLT), and styles (CSS) are separate from each other
