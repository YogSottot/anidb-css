Future *maybe* features in no particular order:
- detailed infos for anime (not for episodes!)
- revamp options, eg. no triple click switch (big lists = long wait when clicking through unwanted option??)
- possibility to hide/show columns
- page design where you have max number of animes per page and can navigate through (some users have a bloody big anime list)
- Awards:
    - use pics from local dir
		- titles
- sort alternative titles: englisch, japanese, rest alphabetically
- show identical titles only once (if possible without alot of work)
- user-switchable CSS
- use more classes to make it easier designing new CSS
- show summary row for selected (via mouse click) animes
- show in select-boxes only values from *filtered* data (currently: from all data)
