The intention of this list is to have a small (by file sizes) list with
all basic informations about the animes and their episodes on your list.
So you can show this list to everyone and even put it on your website.
The list does *not* contain any informations about your files or the subs!

The main focus is using the XSLT rendering capabilities of modern W3C
standard compliant browsers. And keeping everything small and simple
but still with some useful features.

For feedback use the AniDB forum.

Tested with Opera 9.5 and Firefox 2/3.
Internet Explorer is not tested but generally should work fine too.
