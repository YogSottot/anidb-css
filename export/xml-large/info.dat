Version 0.3 (3/07/2007)

Template created by path (scavenged from xml-xslt and xml-dark)
The idea is to try and extract almost everything thats useful into the xml. Please feel free to edit this
and add more data if you need it. However for performance reasons Ive had to move a lot of data into the
anime.tpl xmls rather than the main xml. This makes it harder to get the main table to show information if you need it.
I don't know how to solve this dichotomy.


Added a basic table layout. Filtering and sorting capabilities. Next up, expanding nodes.
