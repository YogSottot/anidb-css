aniDBStyle HTML theme:
- Based mostly on the aniDB MyList layout and dynamics, but with some custom additions/layout changes ^_^.
- Show/Hide anime on MyList by state (undefined, unknown, on hdd, on cd, deleted, and has awards) and by status (complete, incomplete, watched and unviewed).
- Popups with File Information and Episode Information for each file/episode.
- Has an internal "Search page" and an "Trade page" (disabled by default).
- Includes basic support for printing.
- Includes support for wishlist (see change log for notes).
- Link to aniDB, animeNFO and Anime Planet for more info on selected files/episodes/animes.
- Uses all information available to exports, including Awards, Temporary Votes and Jap/Eng Titles.
- Uses local images to reduce server-side load on aniDB servers.
- Anime pages offer different levels of information: simple and expanded (click on the [+]/[-] icons to expand colapse info).
- Uses javascript (intensively), css stylesheets (light) and cookies (optional but recomended).
- Tested and working with: IE 6.0, FireFox PR1, Opera 7.6p1.
