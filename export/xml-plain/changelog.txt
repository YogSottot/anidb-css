History: 
     - Version 1.00 by Chuck Renner (aka chriv)

Changelog:

  1.00 (24.11.2003)
     - First version
     - All data is XML
     - No formating (no CSS, no XSL, no XSD, no HTML, etc.)
     - I was going to include schema (XSD), but I don't know how to
       create standarized schema yet (maybe in a later version)
     - All known known available fields are in a single XML document
       for simplicity
     - Intended for use in importing into external databases
     - Resulting XML tested by importing into MS Access XP (2002)
     - Also intended for by parsing with server-side CGI scripts
       (like PHP/Perl etc.)
     - I changed field names to my liking (and may change them again)
     - MAYBE I add PHP scripts to parse and display the data in a future
       version (no promises)
