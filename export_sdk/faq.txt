1. What are Mylist Exports?

  Mylist exports are a way to export your mylist, providing offline browsing capabilites, it's 
  like a snapshot of the state of your mylist at the moment you requested the export. 

2. Can i create my own template?

  Yes, this page should help you starting with your own template. 

3. What are the requirements for building a template?

  Well, the only true *requirement* is a text editor, though if you wan't to test your template
  before submiting you will need Perl (v5.8.8+) to use the SDK. 

4. Can I include images, external stylesheets/javascript files with my templates?

  Yes, you can copy stylesheet or javascript files directly into the template directory. 
  However images should be placed in a seperate zip file and will be hosted on anidb and linked
  on the export page for seperate download. 
  You also can't include subdirectories, you have to copy the files directly into the directory
  of your template. 

5. How do i create files other than .htm?

  Take a look at the csv-minimal theme. You need to create a file called extension.dat which only
  contains the desired extension, _without_ the dot! 

6. What is that info.dat file?

  It's ment to provide the user with a short info about the template. The content should not be
  too long but is otherwise left to the author of the template. 
  However, it is strongly recommended to begin the file with 3 special lines:
