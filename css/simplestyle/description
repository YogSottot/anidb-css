description: This is my newest AniDB CSS style "SimpleStyle".
Well, what should I say ... I kept it simple and clean. If it's too bright for you, turn down your screen brightness, use sunglasses or wait for a dark version ;)
Internet Explorer not supported due to a css bug - sorry. 
Thanks to zak for his help and great AniDB CSS style
