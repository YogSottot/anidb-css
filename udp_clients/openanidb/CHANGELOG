Changelog:
 - svn 338:
   - Started Windows-specific work. In particular, fixed a network bug
     of the showstopper variety, added support for the Windows icon,
     and generated Windows binaries. You may now log in and hash files
     on Windows.
   - Added COPYING, a copy of the GNU GPL, to the repo. I hope people
     do not bear me ill will for explicitly declaring what they may and
     may not do with my code.
   - Added zero.ico, a Windows icon resource, to the repo. Contains
     16x16, 32x32, and 64x64 icons for Windows to use.
   - Added setup.py, a py2exe script for generating Windows binaries.
     I figured you guys should have it. The binaries will be quite
     large, roughly 11MB; I used UPX and gzip to get it down below the
     5MB mark.
   - Updated README to reflect current project status.
 - svn 337:
   - Renamed classes in openanidb.py and fixed indentation issues. If
     I broke anything doing it, let me know.
   - Added formatting help to the settings dialog. This should make the
     cryptic dollar signs a bit less cryptic. Also, if you want or need
     more formatting strings, let me know.
   - Added default actions (Escape, Enter, etc.) to settings dialog.
   - Unbroke previews for formatted strings in settings. I wish that
     someone had told me sooner that they were broken.
   - Unbroke icky hashing logic.
   - Added substitutions for file moves.
   - Added warning if hashing is started while not logged in.
   - Added safety checks to hashing. Hashing will now halt with an
     error box if it does not have permission to move files or make
     directories.
 - svn 326:
   - Added icon(s). For the curious, it's Zero from "Zero no Tsukaima;"
     I felt she was appropriate considering the nature of this project.
     Want to change it? Modify zero.xpm or add your own zero.xpm to
     your .oadb directory.
   - Hooked up username/password save.
   - New settings: Autologin. When selected, the program will
     automatically try to log you in using the saved name and password.
     OADB won't save a user/pass combo that is not valid.
   - Fixed bug making config files non-persistent on Windows. You should
     delete your old openanidb.ini if you are on Windows!
 - svn 314:
   - Fixed hashing regression when not using PCT and sped up builtin MD4
     slightly.
   - Added Psyco support if Psyco is present.
   - Brought gui_anime() up to date and unbroke anime searching.
   - New settings: Save username and password.
   - Added accelerators to menu items: Ctrl-Q quits and F1 displays 
     About box.
   - Added apsw.Connection.close() to DB operations if APSW is newer than
     version 3.3.7-r1.
 - svn 306:
   - Fixed whitespace issues causing IDLE to crash.
   - Fixed regression in menu code with popups not displaying correctly.
   - Fixed regression in menu code causing popups to show known episodes as
     unknown episodes.
 - svn 304:
   - Incremented version number to 0.3, network number to 2.
   - Moved config files (anime.db, openanidb.ini) to ~/.oadb. Works on Linux,
     should work elsewhere.
   - Fixed broken context menus in data browser. FIXME: File refreshes are not
     currently atomic.
   - Implemented UDP status 201 (Successful login; new version available.)
   - Committed CHANGELOG.
 - svn 296:
   - Initial commit.
