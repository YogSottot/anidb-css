Changelog:
 - svn 326:
   - Added icon(s). For the curious, it's Zero from "Zero no Tsukaima;"
     I felt she was appropriate considering the nature of this project.
     Want to change it? Modify zero.xpm or add your own zero.xpm to
     your .oadb directory.
   - Hooked up username/password save.
   - New settings: Autologin. When selected, the program will
     automatically try to log you in using the saved name and password.
     OADB won't save a user/pass combo that is not valid.
   - Fixed bug making config files non-persistent on Windows. You should
     delete your old openanidb.ini if you are on Windows!
 - svn 314:
   - Fixed hashing regression when not using PCT and sped up builtin MD4
     slightly.
   - Added Psyco support if Psyco is present.
   - Brought gui_anime() up to date and unbroke anime searching.
   - New settings: Save username and password.
   - Added accelerators to menu items: Ctrl-Q quits and F1 displays 
     About box.
   - Added apsw.Connection.close() to DB operations if APSW is newer than
     version 3.3.7-r1.
 - svn 306:
   - Fixed whitespace issues causing IDLE to crash.
   - Fixed regression in menu code with popups not displaying correctly.
   - Fixed regression in menu code causing popups to show known episodes as
     unknown episodes.
 - svn 304:
   - Incremented version number to 0.3, network number to 2.
   - Moved config files (anime.db, openanidb.ini) to ~/.oadb. Works on Linux,
     should work elsewhere.
   - Fixed broken context menus in data browser. FIXME: File refreshes are not
     currently atomic.
   - Implemented UDP status 201 (Successful login; new version available.)
   - Committed CHANGELOG.
 - svn 296:
   - Initial commit.
